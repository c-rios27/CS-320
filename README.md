# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

One of the best ways to keep my code, program, and/or software functional and secure is by testing it consistently.
JUnit testing, as well as functional testing, allowed me to test the code by smaller portions (units), and test for efficiency and functionality.
Other ways that I have ensure the functionality and security of my code is by checking for flaws and vulnerabilities. Dependency checks, such as 
OWASP Dependency Check (Maven), had previously allowed me to check vulnerabilities in my code.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

By translating the user's needs into requirements that are functional and testing the code in smaller portions (or increments), I can interpret the user needs better.
It is important to always allow the user to participate in the SDLC process. This way, we are receiving constant feedback and improving the code further so it can meet the user's needs.

# How do I approach designing software?

For me, the first step is to gather the requirements and see what is being asked of me. Once I have requirements in hand, there are things that I will look and work towards for:
user feedback, functionality, modularity, and security. Once I have started coding/designing the software, I will begin unit testing, as well as checking for any possible flaws and vulnerabilities.
And, lastly, as I mentioned on the final project reflection, always check for happy and unhappy paths while designing the software, from start to finish.
